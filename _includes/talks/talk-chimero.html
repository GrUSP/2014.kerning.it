            Words are vessels of thought and culture. As our words jump from screen to page, medium to medium, it becomes a designer’s task to develop design approaches and typographic systems that can elegantly retain their integrity from place to place, while using each format’s advantages. Content moves in both directions: we can use the connectivity of digital to invigorate printed material, but also use the uniformity of the printed page to stabilize digital content. It’s a difficult task, but we have examples. I’ll track patterns back into television, documentaries, and paperbacks to look for clues about how to take advantage of this decade’s big design opportunity.
