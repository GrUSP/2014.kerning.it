        <div class="abstract">
            Typography on the web has made huge leaps forward in recent years, allowing web designers to realize their designs with an almost print-like level of control. However, the details surrounding that control can still be challenging, and bleeding-edge technology like OpenType support is still in flux. In this talk, Typekitâ€™s Creative Director and 8 Faces founder Elliot Jay Stocks takes attendees through some of the most exciting recent developments that allow us to take web-based typography to the next level.
